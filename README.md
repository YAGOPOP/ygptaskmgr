Small cli programme made just for practicing in rust.

In Windows application data is located in "C:\Users\USER\AppData\Roaming\yagopop\ygptaskmgr\data\tasks.json"

After install you can use programme like this:`ygptaskmgr [command]` or just call the programme like `ygptaskmgr`.

The portable version is almost the same. You can use it like `.\ygptaskmgr.exe [command]` or open the executable in any convenient way.
